# Shared Preferences Implementation for Foodio App

## Overview
This implementation adds shared preferences functionality to manage onboarding completion status and user login information in the Foodio Flutter app.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Shared Preferences Service (`lib/repositories/shared_preferences_service.dart`)
- **Singleton pattern** for efficient memory usage
- **Onboarding management**: Track whether user has completed onboarding
- **User session management**: Store user login status, ID, email, and username
- **Data persistence**: All data persists across app restarts
- **Cleanup methods**: Clear user data on logout or complete reset

### 2. Authentication Integration
- **Sign Up**: Automatically saves user data to shared preferences after successful registration
- **Sign In**: Saves user data to shared preferences after successful login
- **Sign Out**: Clears all user data from shared preferences

### 3. Smart Routing Logic
- **Splash Screen**: Determines the correct initial route based on:
  - Onboarding completion status
  - User login status
- **Route Flow**:
  - First time users → Onboarding Screen
  - Returning users (not logged in) → Sign In Screen
  - Logged in users → Home Screen

### 4. Onboarding Management
- **Skip functionality**: Marks onboarding as completed when user skips
- **Complete functionality**: Marks onboarding as completed when user finishes all pages
- **One-time only**: Onboarding won't show again once completed

## Key Files Modified

### New Files Created:
- `lib/repositories/shared_preferences_service.dart` - Main service for shared preferences
- `lib/utils/preferences_debug.dart` - Debug utilities for testing
- `SHARED_PREFERENCES_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Files Modified:
- `lib/repositories/auth_repository.dart` - Added shared preferences integration
- `lib/screens/splash_screen/splash_screen.dart` - Added smart routing logic
- `lib/screens/onboard_screen/onboarding_screen.dart` - Added completion tracking
- `lib/screens/authentication/sign_in_screen.dart` - Updated navigation
- `lib/screens/authentication/sign_up_screen.dart` - Updated navigation
- `lib/screens/profile/profile_screen.dart` - Updated logout navigation

## Usage Examples

### Check if user has completed onboarding:
```dart
final prefs = await SharedPreferencesService.getInstance();
bool isCompleted = await prefs.isOnboardingCompleted();
```

### Save user login data:
```dart
await prefs.setUserLoggedIn(true);
await prefs.setUserId(userId);
await prefs.setUserEmail(email);
await prefs.setUsername(username);
```

### Clear user data on logout:
```dart
await prefs.clearUserData();
```

## Debug Utilities

The `PreferencesDebug` class provides helpful methods for testing:

```dart
// Print all current preferences
await PreferencesDebug.printAllPreferences();

// Clear all data (for testing)
await PreferencesDebug.clearAllData();

// Reset onboarding status (for testing)
await PreferencesDebug.resetOnboarding();
```

## Testing the Implementation

1. **First Launch**: App should show onboarding screens
2. **Skip Onboarding**: Should mark as completed and go to sign in
3. **Complete Onboarding**: Should mark as completed and go to sign in
4. **Sign Up**: Should save user data and go to home screen
5. **Sign In**: Should save user data and go to home screen
6. **App Restart**: Should go directly to home screen if logged in
7. **Sign Out**: Should clear data and go to sign in screen
8. **App Restart After Logout**: Should go to sign in screen

## Error Handling

- All shared preferences operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Graceful fallbacks for initialization failures
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

## Dependencies

The implementation uses the existing `shared_preferences: ^2.5.3` dependency that was already included in `pubspec.yaml`.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Biometric Authentication**: Could integrate with device biometrics
2. **Auto-login**: Could implement automatic login for returning users
3. **Offline Support**: Could cache more user data for offline usage
4. **Data Encryption**: Could encrypt sensitive data in shared preferences
